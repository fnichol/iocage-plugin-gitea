## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of
conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this
code. Please report unacceptable behavior to fnichol@nichol.ca.

## Issues

If you have any problems with or questions about this project, please contact us

## Contributing

You are invited to contribute to new features, fixes, or updates, large or
small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to
process them as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub
issue][issues], especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other
contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on
your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

## Release History

This project uses a "deployable master" strategy, meaning that the `master`
branch is assumed to be working and production ready. As such there is no formal
versioning process and therefore also no formal changelog documentation.
